# ABC-PMC for HOD 

Application of ABC PMC in constraining the parameters of the halo model using HALOTOOLS

## Internal To-Do List

- [NOT SO HIGH] Implement convergence criteria
- [HIGH] Multiple threshold
    * [ ] Profiled comparison
- [ ] Implement HOD group richness
    * [HIGH] Find appropriate richness binning scheme
    * [HIGH] Find a proper way to compue covariance matrix and a way to incorporate into the distance metric
    * [LOW] How to handle systematics of group richness in the data

- [HIGH] Get Hogg to write into intro of HOD paper.

- [HIGH] Ensure all relevant components of halotools are reliable.
